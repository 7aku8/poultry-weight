## Poultry weight

### Automated weighting system for poultry

This project is a simple automated system for weighing poultry. It uses a load cell to measure the weight of the poultry
and a microcontroller to control the system. The system is designed to be used in a poultry farm to monitor the weight
of the poultry and to provide data for the farmer to make decisions.

Main microcontroller used for this project is NodeMCU-ESP8266. The load cell is connected to the microcontroller using a
HX711 amplifier.
